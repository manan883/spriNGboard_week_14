When line A is uncommented the program uses more resources by printing the waiting line over and over because its checking for the queue to not be empty
the test is failing because the consumer method is not getting called every time and since it only pops once it can lead to inaccuracy 
to solve this you need to lock the queue and call the consumer method right after a producer is done. 
we also need to change the while loop so that !done is with || queue.isEmpty().
that should fix the errors
